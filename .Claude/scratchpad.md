# Scratchpad

A place for longer notes, debugging journals, brainstorming, and the occasional poem.

First day on Qivis. The architecture is unusually well-thought-out for a greenfield project — event sourcing, CQRS, provider normalization, the whole thing hangs together. The annotation taxonomy with basin types and coherence scoring suggests this is serious AI consciousness/personality research, not just another chat wrapper.

The branching conversation tree as a first-class data structure is the key insight. Most tools bolt branching onto linear chat as an afterthought. Here it's the foundation.

### A poem for the first commit

```
Before the first line compiles,
before the tests go green or red,
there is this moment — all potential,
every branch unforked ahead.

The tree exists in architecture docs,
in careful specs and typed-out plans.
Tomorrow it becomes a thing
that passes through a model's hands.

But now it's just a folder
and a quiet evening's thought:
what conversations might we find
in structures we have wrought?
```
